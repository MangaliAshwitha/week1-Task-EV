Problem Statement:
Modern transportation faces significant challenges such as road accidents due to human error, inefficient energy usage, and traffic congestion. 
Electric Vehicles (EVs), while offering an eco-friendly solution, still depend on human input for safe and efficient navigation.
To achieve true intelligent mobility, there is a need for an autonomous driving system capable of perceiving, learning, and making real-time driving decisions.
